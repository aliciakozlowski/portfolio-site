            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>As an intern on the Dell Alienware/XPS teams, I was tasked with creating a project that would explore innovative futures in a field tangentially related to Dell. The scope, timeline, and deliverables were all determined by myself with the help of mentorship from the Alienware team.<br><br>The final presentation was given to upper-management of Dell Design as well as follow up presentations with coworkers from the design department and individuals from the Alienware marketing team. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="video-caption">The system works by  providing two access points where the key works. One is in the facility, the other a remote dock that athletes can take with them and access gaming across campus. These link back up to the server database to access the new university gaming cloud.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">Due to universities wanting their facilities to be unique to them, offering different colorways provides the opportunity for each facility to tie back into school colors and school pride.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">Removing monitors frees up desk space and allows screen size to be adjusted based on facility need or privacy. Users would be able to open multiple windows and take advantage of the wide amount of space. This highlights the drastic change from 30” of cramped playing to allowing players to feel like they have infinite space.</p>

        <p class="video-caption">As teams come together to play, their chosen avatars would be highlighted, bringing a more immersive experience to onboarding. Their key’s loop lighting would be able to change color to coordinate with the avatar or team itself.<br><br>Keys of team members sync up to provide onlookers, as well as coaches, information on how the game is progressing and how well the team is working together. Coaches would be able to see visual feedback when certain skills are practiced.</p>

Screens can be merged and enlarged to allow for a new atmosphere for both those viewing and those playing. The clear displays at the top allow for general understanding of game progress.</p>
